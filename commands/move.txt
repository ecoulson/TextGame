Move

Usages:
    - move
        this signifies that a user would like to move from a tile but has not determined which direction.
        The game will then prompt the player for a direction in which to move. The game then attempts to
        move the player.

    - move [direction (North | East | South | West)]
        This command siginifes that the player would like to move and in which direction. The game then
        attempts to move the player in the passed direction. The direction you would like to move can also
        be reduced down to only the first letter in the direction. For example N -> North. So [move n] moves
        to the north

Results:
    The result of any move command results in either the player moving in the specified direction,
    or a collision occurs. When a collision occurs it is siginified in red text showing that there
    has been a collision. Otherwise the player will move in the passed direction and the game will
    display a success message.

Notes:
    The player may also world wrap, meaning that the world exists on a torus that would techincally 
    break if gravity was a thing. Thankfully its a text based video game so we dont have to worry 
    about our world crumbiling. Besides via dragons. They can sometimes cause cataclysms
